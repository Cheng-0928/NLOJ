 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.

 *= require bootstrap_import
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self
 *= require custom_styles
 *
 * Somehow the ".default" in theme.default is stripped by sprocket 4 asset finding logic.
 * We add another .default to as an dirty hack to make it find the correct asset.
